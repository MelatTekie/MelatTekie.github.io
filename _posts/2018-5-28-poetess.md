  Fox network, in its popular animated sitcom “The Simpsons”, captures the lives of a simple American family with an obscure lifestyle. Homer Simpson, the head of the Simpson family household is a typical family-man, who works in a nuclear-plant. As the episodes of the show progresses it becomes abundantly clear that Homer does not have the slightest bit of knowledge or interest in Art (music, books, paintings…), in fact on several occasions he is seen mocking and infuriating his daughter Lisa for her love there of it. On an interesting episode last week (“Homer is where the art isn’t”), he is seen obsessing over Joan Miro’s oil painting Poetess.  When Lisa asks him why he loves it so much he describes the colors, the lines, the shapes in the paining.



  By the way he describes it, he manages to zoom the audience into clearly seeing the aesthetics properties (the form and design) of the painting. Homer is seen being fixated, transcended and euphoric after viewing the paining. For him, time stopped, and he was stuck in the painting, I was amazed that just the design had so much effect on him, but it was not until I was introduced to Clive bell that I understood what Homer felt was “aesthetic emotion”.  
  
  Clive Bell was an English art critique who was largely associated with formalism. Bell, in his attempt to respond to the post impressionism phenomenon and abstract art came up with a theory called significant form. In this theory, Bell states that the one common quality that each visual art work encompass that evokes “aesthetic emotion” is their significant form. According to Bell, significant form is the combination of lines and colors. It is the form or design of the art work. Bell makes it clear that in a visual work of art the design element is the most important and what essentially makes the art valuable. Bell makes note of the fact that it’s the design element that the artist is truly in control of and ergo this element is where the value of the art work lays. In his writing Bell is objective and he attacks subjective taste.

  If we use the Poetess and Homer Simpson as examples of the visual art work and audience respectively in the analysis of Bells theory, I believe his hypothesis makes complete sense. The significant form of the Poetess is the very factor that grasps Homers attention. It is the very factor that to him it has value. Without the texture, without the design a simple man such as himself would have never found the beauty (the aesthetics) of the painting. Here, Homer Simpson did not care what the artist wanted to say, he did not care what story the painting was trying to tell, for him what mattered the most was the design, hence the significant form.

  Critiques of bell would mention two flaws in his theory. The first being that art is art because it evokes emotion because it tells a story not because of the colors and lines. The second would be that the artist is also trying to tell us something with the art, the form is just a coincidence. I disagree with both these notions.

  If art is considered art only based on it evoking a certain kind of emotion and the design aspect was completely disregarded, the most famous paintings, books and music would have not been deemed art and would have been long forgotten. This is because of two reasons, the first is that no matter how good a work of art is in depicting emotion human beings are complex, what moves me might not move you and vice versa. The second reason is if we look at art from the shoes of the mass public that has no interest in the meaning it is trying to depict but rather the way it looks. “I like it because I like it”, this is a very common term we hear at a gallery or a museum. Would this make it less of an art? Another good argument that shows the value of design and form is the fact that art schools critique and praise paintings based on design as well. 

  “The artist is trying to tell us something, the design just happened”. This is what most people assume when they view abstract art. The biggest challenge to this argument is in Bells reading. That is, the artist can in no way have control over the emotions of thousands of people who will view his painting, but he will have complete control on the design element of his work. Therefore, design and form matter and make the art valuable. 

  In conclusion, I would like to state that in my above notions I am in no way disregarding the ability of art to tell a story or evoke emotion. I am simply stating the significance of design element and the value it has when it comes to visual art.
